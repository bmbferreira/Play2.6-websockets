# Experiment with Websockets, Scala and Play v2.6
Small experiment with websockets using scala and the play framework (2.6). It is a basic web application that connects the client with the server using a websocket, gathers information about the Lisbon weather every 5 seconds and shows the json response in the web interface (and also logs it on the console).
